# Reflection â€“ AI Weather Advisor Application

The project is about developing a Weather Advisor Application. It combined software design, API integration, and user experience development. The project began with a simple idea on creating an app that provided weather forecasts, but evolved into a responsive, interactive platform that interprets user questions and displays real-time data through visual charts.

I explored AI models like Ollama for natural-language understanding and initially i used llama3 model and due to the memory issue I replaced llama3 with llama3.2:1b model which occupies less space and supported to obtain required output. This alternative achieved similar functionality by extracting keywords and city names directly from user questions. It demonstrated how structured logic and creativity can often replace heavy AI models without compromising usability or performance.

Working with Flask taught me about web routing, API handling, and structuring modular Python applications. I learned to manage requests, return JSON data, and build interactive dashboards using Chart.js. Including Chart.js helped me appreciate the role of data visualisation in enhancing user understanding, especially for trends like temperature variations and precipitation probability. This strengthened my backend-frontend integration skills and helped me to know the importance of clear, maintainable architecture.

From a design perspective, I realised how crucial user feedback and interface clarity are. Adding small touches like a loading indicator and a responsive layout, significantly improved the user experience. These improvements reflected an iterative, feedback-driven development process similar to professional software projects.

From an ethical and sustainability perspective, the project strengthen the need to design applications that are transparent, resource-efficient, and user-centric. By eliminating heavy models and relying on open, freely accessible data sources, I ensured the system remained inclusive, accessible, and environmentally conscious.

Overall, this project enhanced my technical confidence and design thinking. It taught me to balance functionality, simplicity, and user engagement while using AI as a collaborative development partner rather than just a generator. The process demonstrated how guided the AI conversations can be in seeking problem-solving and help translate conceptual ideas into functional, user-centered solutions.
