Prompt:
--------

I want to build a simple AI-powered chatbot that answers weather-related user queries such as 'Do I need an umbrella today?' or 'Is it hot outside?'. Suggest logic or code that uses weather data to generate natural responses.

AI Response (code excerpt):
----------------------------

def weather_chatbot(intent, data):
    if "umbrella" in intent.lower():
        if float(data["precip_mm"]) > 0:
            return "Yes, take an umbrella — rain is likely today."
        else:
            return "No umbrella needed — clear skies ahead!"
    elif "hot" in intent.lower():
        return "It's quite warm today." if float(data["temp_C"]) > 28 else "It's mild outside."

Before:
--------
Static text response for all user queries.

After:
-------
Dynamic rule-based system integrated in `llama_generate_response()`
- Added keyword checks ("umbrella", "hot", "cold", "windy")
- Extended to generate natural language responses via Llama model

Reflection:
------------
This made the chatbot more context-aware and conversational.
